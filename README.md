# RustRayTracer

## About
This is a simple ray-tracer implementation in Rust of [Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing In One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book. This is the first of the series:

- Ray tracing in one weekend, in Rust
- [Ray tracing: the next week, in Rust](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html)
- [Ray tracing: the rest of your life, in Rust](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheRestOfYourLife.html)

It serves as a learning tool for understanding the basics of ray tracing and the Rust programming language.
Every commit in the code implements a particular chapter. In this way it's easy to follow the progress in the book.
